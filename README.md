# rfstools
Remote file system tools for data manipulation between remote /and local host/ (cp, mv, ls, rm,..) written in Python3. 
This package provides you executables pcp, pls, pmv,..., which enables you to do painless data operations on remote/between remote and local host using SFTP/FTP/FTPS/SMB/FS(local file system) protocols.

Furthermore you can enable data reencoding during data transfer (CRLF/LF and character reencoding). 

In future, it should be possible to do atomical transaction transfers between many hosts so you are sure, that after failure (eg. connection loss), no change is made on any host.
